# UNITY-Shellbox-OnHalt

*** UPDATE - ON HALT ***
Currently on halt due to an unforseen issue with the controls, might need to change the entire mechanics of the game to get it to work properly.

Have you ever dreamt of breaking some eggs?

And how about STABBING SOME SWORD-WIELDING JET-PROPELLED STRANGELY-COLORED EGGS?? IN SPACE?!

Well in Shellbox, your dreams can come true!

Features:

* Become an egg!

* Eggsterminate your friends in multiplayer aerial battle!

* Wield a sword and deal devastating blows! Stabby stabby!

* Fly around with jets and avoid becoming an omelette!

* Pretty eggsplosions!



***NOTES***

*Full screen advised

*Mobile is not yet supported

This game is a demo made as an assignment but it might (and probably will) continue to develop. 

Shellbox is currently 2-player ONLY, there is no single-player mode.

There are many things we want to add in the future so do keep in mind that it is currently only a basic demo demonstrating some key-concepts of the game.

All ideas, suggestions, recommendations, bug reports, general opinions etc. are more than welcome and will ALL be read and taken into account.

Thank you for playing and we hope you will enjoy! :)
