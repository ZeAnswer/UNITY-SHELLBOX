TASKS:
* code:
    * ExplosionEffect- fix force calculation so MAX_FORCE will really be the max
    * HitControl- Make a smarter way to get contactType
    

* sounds/visuals:
    * Faces
    
    * better background


* UI:
    * preferences tab to edit keys, sound volume
    * control settings- button with text showing current key
        press button to show "press key"
        make sure pressing "esc" won't close tab and that it cannot be assigned
        have all button texts linked to preferenceData, make sure to update them
        after a Set function

* gameplay:
    * rope/hook
        * Make hook attached joint have strong springs to keep it stuck
        * optimal break force might be around 10k-15k for hook joint
        * when hook is attached to ground, going up will disconnect the rope. figure out a way to fix this.
        * in general increase rope spring strength
    * more interesting map, obstacles, moving parts, colors etc..
    
    

* bugs:
    * In-game, sword gets crooked for some reason
    * In-game, gravity sphere not affected by gravity?
    * after restart one started turned, I think after he died - CHECK

    

SOUNDS NEEDED:
1. egg hit hard surface
2. sword out (weak and short, could be repeated quickly)
3. jets (might want to find a way to slightly randomize output)
4. sword hit egg
5. egg explode
6. bgm



DONE:
* when dead, disable sword and jets
* Egg location = Actual player location, not the parent location. need to fix the "Birth" and effect locations somehow
* jets should be children of egg, not fixed joints
* basic UI to start game and exit game
* Colors
* Optimal force for jets probably around 500-550
* change player data to be an array, using player ID as index
* same goes for PlayerManager
* maybe max lives will be 11 because it's max spare lives, otherwise I need to remove 1 life at each birth and not at each death
* Update lives amount after restart
* SOUNDS!!
* How To Play on main menu
* audio needs mute "check" and volume bar, later on add bars and mutes
        for different sounds (effects, BGM, voices etc)
* PLAYER X WINS message, button to return to main menu
